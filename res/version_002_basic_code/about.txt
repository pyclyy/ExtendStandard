Simple Fur/Hair Demo

Demonstrates the basic principle of creating a simple fur/hair effect using
transparency and layers.

Best way to understand it, is to think of an onion, if all the layers where
transparent, you'd see nothing, now imagine, you had a blob, in the same place
on each of the layers...because each of the layers are so close together
it looks like a single long extruded pole or spike etc.

Now imagine this principle, but with lots of dots/noise for the surfaces..
you get a sort of fur effect.  

Demo key inputs:

Up/Down Keys: Fur Lengths

Home/End: Number of layers

Left/Right: Scales texture (finer/chubbier fur effect)

Also you can rotate the object using the mouse while pressing the
left mouse button.

Misc Other Additions:

Z & X for changing the fur density of the texture - slow as it has to
destroy and rebuid the texture.

Right mouse button & drag to zoom in and out of the fur.

Basic gravity effects - pressing G will bias the fur so you get a
force acting downwards on the hairs/fur layers so you get a moving
up/down force in real time.
